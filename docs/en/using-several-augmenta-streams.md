# Using several Augmenta streams

####

You can receive different Augmenta streams in the same Unity application as long as they are not on the same OSC port. You need to add an Augmenta prefab (i.e. AugmentaManager) for each incoming stream, then set each AugmentaManager ID and input port to listen to each protocol.
